# Basic Web-scraper

This application will scrape static sites for info depending on user input!

Things needed:
- Python 3.x
- Thats it!

Once downloaded:
- Open bws.py
- Paste url
- Inspect element the info that you want on the page
- Input element and class

My script auto installs and imports modules needed to scrape the web!
Have fun!

There are two variants:
1. mainbws.py
	- Is an ordinary web-scraper
2. loopbws.py
	- It loops continuously, updating the text on screen!
	- Can be used for stocks!

Use mainbws.py first to get a feel for the script!

### NOTE: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION BEING SCRAPED OFF THE WEB! SCRAPE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!!!!
